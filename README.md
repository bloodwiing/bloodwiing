## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I am BLOODWIING, a weird Lithuanian human.

I am an indie developer obsessed with minimalism and video games.

#### I know how to code in:
* C#
* Python
* Java
* JS
* C++

#### Currently working on Discord bots such as:
* [Brawl Box](https://top.gg/bot/531858459512012811)
* [Enchanted](https://top.gg/bot/697879596040716455)

#### My most beloved GitHub repositories:
* [BrawlMapGen](https://github.com/thedonciuxx/BrawlMapGen)

I've also worked on multiple games, but I have yet to actually release any ^^'
