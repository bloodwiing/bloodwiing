## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I am BLOODWIING, a weird Lithuanian human.

I am an indie developer obsessed with minimalism and video games.

#### I know how to code in:
* C#
* Python
* Java
* JS
* C++
* Elixir

#### Currently working on Projects:
* A speed game
* [Rumble Royale](https://top.gg/bot/693167035068317736)

#### My most beloved GitHub repositories:
* [BrawlMapGen](https://github.com/thedonciuxx/BrawlMapGen)
* [Rook's Gambit](https://github.com/bloodwiing/UniProjectChess)

I've also worked on multiple games, but I have yet to actually release any ^^'
